# Workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Donâ€™t touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- please start analyzing full flow thoroughly, always state a confidence score 1 to 10
- Before and after any tool use, give me a confidence level (0-10) on how the tool use will help the project.
- List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before completing this task.
- Don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution
